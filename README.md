# MCServerStatus

**Disclaimer** This script no longer works as intended. Skins will not be fetched. Also, this script no longer receives any updates or support.

**NOTE**: I didn't create this script, but the author has disappeared. I like the script a lot, and it's very extensible as it uses the [Minetools.eu API](http://api.minetools.eu)

You will need to edit some of the variables at the top of the file (server IP, ports, etc.) and you can also customize some of the other features as well such as what kind of player avatars you want (if any), and what the site's section headers say.
